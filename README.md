#  Exploration-of-event-segmentation-theory-using-LSTM

The project was aimed to test the plausibility of applying LSTM to Event Segmentation Theory.
A bouncing ball model was used to test how the LSTM NN behave and store informations.

The following report in Research Gate is my master thesis delineating the details.

## Contents of the folders

Java code folder contains Java projects, which basically is the main body of the simulation tool. There are bouoncing ball models in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. 

Matlab code folder contains files for plotting and plots. Most plots are for testing and experimenting during the project, and therefore neglegible if you only want to check how the plots were generated. The MatLab codes in the folder are the original ones that I used by the time I finish the thesis. But they should not be used and modified anymore.

Matlab Codes contains the complete set of the Matlab codes to generate all the plots and data used int the thesis. Including those plotting the nonlinearity of the gates.

Check The Wiki for further information of each Java project.
