# Exploration-of-event-segmentation-theory-using-LSTM

The project was aimed to test the plausibility of applying LSTM to Event Segmentation Theory.
A bouncing ball model was used to test how the LSTM NN behave and store informations.

The following report in Research Gate is my master thesis delineating the details.
