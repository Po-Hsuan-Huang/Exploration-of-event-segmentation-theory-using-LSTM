This trial I ran 1000 times to generate 1000 samples. 

The weights_in and weights_out can be used to 


(1)

run MatLab code MainForPCAWeightAnalysis.m 

it will give out the best weight classes.

(2)

it can be used to run RndInitWeight.m to

see how each weight of each cell in LSTM is distributed in the 

best trained 100 samples. 

(3)

run weightEvolution.m

to see the relation between weight_in and weight_out.

The convergence of weight_out should be a telltale which weight is more important.
